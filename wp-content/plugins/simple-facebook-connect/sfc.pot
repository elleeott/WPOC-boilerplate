"<p>Each separate plugin can be enabled or disabled using the checkboxes "
"below. Only enable the plugins you want to use, and the rest will not run at "
"all! Here's a quick description of each plugin:</p>\r\n"
"<ul>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Login</strong> - The Login plugin allows your users to login "
"using their Facebook Credentials. To do this, \r\n"
"\tit adds a Facebook button on the Login screen. There is also a button on "
"the Users' profile screen to allow them \r\n"
"\tto connect or disconnect their account from Facebook. The User's Facebook "
"ID number will be stored as usermeta \r\n"
"\tand can be used for many things.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Register</strong> - The Register plugin changes the normal "
"WordPress user registration mechanism into the \r\n"
"\tFacebook Register plugin mechanism. This lets users easily register using "
"their Facebook credentials, or to \r\n"
"\tregister without having any credentials. Users who register with FB "
"credentials will automatically be able to \r\n"
"\tLogin using their FB credentials in the Login plugin. As an added bonus, "
"FB Register adds a CAPTCHA to the \r\n"
"\tregistration process, helping to eliminate spam registrations.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Like</strong> - The Like plugin will let you automatically or "
"manually add Like and Send buttons to all \r\n"
"\tthe Posts and Pages on your site.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Share</strong> - The Share plugin will let you automatically add "
"a second Like button to all the Posts and \r\n"
"\tPages on your site. This is styled to look similar to the older, now "
"removed, \"Share\" feature Facebook used \r\n"
"\tto offer, but it doesn't have the same kind of popup dialog any longer.</"
"p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Publish</strong> - The Publish plugin will let you automatically "
"send new posts and pages to either your \r\n"
"\tsite's main Facebook Page or your personal Facebook Profile. Automatically "
"posted entries also get metadata \r\n"
"\tabout the Facebook post saved about them, for use by other plugins.</p></"
"li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - The Widgets plugin adds several widgets that "
"can be used by your site's sidebar (or \r\n"
"\tany other widget areas in your theme). Most of these come from the \r\n"
"\t<a href='http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/'>Facebook Social "
"Plugins</a>.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Comments</strong> - The Comments plugin will let your users use "
"Facebook credentials to make comments, and \r\n"
"\toffer those users an option to share their comments, and your post, on "
"Facebook. This basically eliminates the \r\n"
"\tneed for users to type in their Names and Email addresses. Note that some "
"themes do checking for these \"required\" \r\n"
"\telements via Javascript. Because Facebook Comments get these fields filled "
"on the back end, the theme may need to \r\n"
"\tbe modified to both display the button or to eliminate the javascript "
"requirements checks.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Integrate Comments</strong> - The Comment Integration plugin "
"will interact with the saved data from the \r\n"
"\tautomatic publishing plugin, and periodically poll Facebook for new "
"comments made to your auto-published stories. \r\n"
"\tComments will then be pulled from Facebook and integrated into the "
"normally displayed comments stream.</p></li>\r\n"
"<li><strong>Photos</strong> - The Photos plugin adds a new tab to the Media "
"Uploader on the Edit Post pages, which will \r\n"
"\tshow your Facebook photo albums and let you easily embed pictures from "
"Facebook into your posts.</p></li>\r\n"
